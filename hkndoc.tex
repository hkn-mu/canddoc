	\chapter{What is HKN?}
    \label{ch:what-is-hkn}

    \section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:introduction}
        Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) is the national Electrical Engineering and Computer Science honor society.
        The organization was founded at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 1904.
        There are over \href{https://hkn.ieee.org/chapters/university-chapters}{260 chapters} worldwide, with over 200,000 members inducted.
        Chapter activites are organized around the recognition of academic accomplishment, the promotion of volunteer service, and the development of leadership and collaborative skills. \\

        At UC Berkeley, we are the Mu (\(\mu\)) Chapter, which was founded in 1915.
        We are one of the most, if not the most, active chapters of HKN in the entire world, having won the Outstanding Chapter Award for the past 23 years in a row.
        This semester (Spring '24), we have 60+ active officers working across 10 committees.
        We provide services to the general EECS community, the EECS Department, the College of Engineering, and the community at Berkeley as a whole.
        
    \section{Membership and Operations}
    \label{sec:membership-and-operations}
        Membership in HKN is extended to a certain subset of students in EECS every semester.
        Those who accept the invitation are known as \emph{Candidates}.
        They then engage in the \emph{Candidate Semester}, which gives them a full tour of what it's like to be in HKN.
        After completing requirements, they initiate at the end of the semester as nationally-inducted members. \\

        Members can then run during \emph{Elections} to become \emph{Officers} or \emph{Assistant Officers}, roles with required weekly/semesterly responsibilities for a specific committee and HKN as a whole.
        Some general services that HKN provides are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Exam Review Sessions for lower-division EECS courses
            \item Free Drop-in Tutoring Hours
            \item Resume Critiques
            \item Career Fairs
            \item Department Tours
            \item EECS Day for high school and middle school students
            \item Info Sessions with companies
            \item Post-Exam Fruit Snack Attacks
            \item Going Down the EECS Stack Decal
            \item Make Your Own Boba Events
            \item Palentines/Palloween
            \item And much more!
        \end{itemize}
        The listed services are just a peek into what HKN does as an organization.
        Members also have participate in semesterly retreats, socials, food hangouts, and other events!
        It's definitely a work hard, play hard environment.

    \newpage
    \chapter{Candidate Semester}
    \label{ch:candidate-semester}

    \section{Being a Candidate}
    \label{sec:being-a-candidate}
        Congratulations on being invited to HKN!
        Candidacy is extended to the top 1/3 of students with senior standing and the top 1/4 of students with junior standing, with standing being determined by units completed. \\
        
        Being a candidate means that you'll go through the \emph{Candidate Semester}, which is the semester that you are invited to HKN.
        The Candidate Semester is designed for you to learn about HKN and have a bunch of fun meeting people.
        You'll get to attend many events ranging from fun to community service, be a part of a big-little system, have the opportunity to work with a committee, and so much more.
        This section is dedicated to providing you with all the information you'll need to make the most out of your Candidate Semester! \\

        \textbf{Your primary point of contact during the Candidate Semester will be the External Vice President (EVP - Aaron Guo, Spring '24)}, but you will have a couple of other assigned people to talk to and ask questions if you ever need to.


    \section{Requirements}
        As a candidate, you'll have some requirements to complete in order to initiate as a member at the end of the semester.
        While this might seem like a LOT of work at first glance, we promise that it's not and is actually super fun!
        Aside from General Meetings, these requirements should really only take about an hour or two of your time per week of the Candidate Semester. \\
        
        \textbf{Now, let's actually get into the requirements:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item
                    \textbf{Attend Candidate Meeting (CM)}: You've probably already done this if you're reading this.
                    \textbf{If you couldn't make CM, reach out to your EVP for alternatives if you haven't already.}
                \item
                    \textbf{Attend all 3 General Meetings (GMs)}: These are integral to your Candidate Semester experience and are the most important events to make.
                    \textbf{If you can't make one of these, let your EVP know immediately.}
                \item
                    \textbf{Pay 2 sets of dues}: There will be 2 sets of dues throughout the Candidate Semester.
                    The first set is mandated by the national HKN organization and is the fee to initiate your lifelong membership in HKN.
                    This money goes straight to them and we at Berkeley personally do not gain anything from or take any portion of this fee.
                    The second set is to help pay for Banquet at the end of the semester, where we celebrate the new initiates, give out awards, and more.
                    \textbf{If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these dues, please reach out to your EVP and we'll work something out.}
                \item
                    \textbf{Attend 3 Fun events}: Fun events are exactly what they sound like - fun!
                    There will be multiple, varied activities every week for you to take part in and enjoy.
                \item
                    \textbf{Attend 1 Big Fun event}: Big Funs are Funs but bigger!
                    These events span from going to SF, having a puzzle-solving race across campus, participating in large-scale field events, and more.
                \item
                    \textbf{Attend 1 Community event}: Community events are meant for you to hang out with the greater EECS community or the general community at Berkeley.
                    These range from chill make-your-own boba sessions, playing board games, collaborating with other organizations, and more.
                \item
                    \textbf{Attend 1 Service event}: Service is a core pillar of HKN.
                    You'll have the opportunity to help out at our annual Junior EECS Day for prospective middle school students, assist the Berkeley Project, detrash areas around Berkeley, and more.
                \item
                    \textbf{Attend 1 Member Hangout}: Our member will be hosting their own hangouts for you to learn more about them and have some fun!
                    \textbf{At least one member at the hangout must be someone who is not your byte.}
                \item
                    \textbf{Complete 1 Member Challenge}: Member will constantly be giving challenges out in the \#challenges channel in the candidate Slack.
                    We'll also have some dedicated time during General Meetings for challenges to be given out and taken.
                    \textbf{Your challenge must be issued by an member who is not your byte.}
                \item
                    \textbf{Complete 3 Bit-Byte Hangouts}: As part of your Candidate Semester, you'll be part of a Bit-Byte group.
                    Hang out with them!
                    More details about Bit-Byte groups can be found in the \hyperref[sec:bit-byte-groups]{Bit-Byte section} below.
                \item
                    \textbf{Complete your Candidate Project}: As part of your Candidate Semester, you'll be assigned to one of nine committees.
                    You'll be given a Candidate Project to complete, which is all about learning and getting involved in the work your committee does.
                    More details about the this can be found in the \hyperref[sec:candidate-project]{Candidate Project section} below.
                \item
                    \textbf{Attend Candidate Check-in}: During the latter half of the Candidate Semester, you will be required to meet with your EVP for a short 15 minute appointment to discuss how your Candidate Semester is going, how you're liking HKN, and whether or not you're interested in running for officership.
                    This is just a chill check-in to make sure that you're on track to initiate and answer any questions or concerns you might have.
                \item
                    \textbf{Complete the Candidate Quiz}: There will be a short Candidate Quiz to check that you are involved with HKN and its current members.
                    We promise it's very easy!
                    Answers to the quiz can be found in this document and other relevant links that you'll often use throughout the Candidate Semester.
                    If you find that you're struggling to find any of the answers, you can ask an member to help you out.
            \end{itemize}

        \textbf{
            There's a couple of steps for having something count towards the completion of a requirement.
            Here's what they are:
        }
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item
                \href{https://hkn.mu/cal}{RSVP to an event on the calendar} corresponding to the type of requirement you're working on.
            \item
                Attend the event (lol).
            \item
                At the end of the event, you will either be manually checked off by an member or there will be attendance/check-in password.
                This will be given out by the member(s) hosting the event at the end of the event.
                Enter this password in the RSVP page of the event to get credit for it.
        \end{enumerate}
        To see your progress towards completing your requirements, check out the \href{https://hkn.mu/candportal}{Candidate Portal} on the HKN Dev website.
        \textbf{The deadline to complete all of your requirements is Root Beer Float Night (RBFN), which takes place in the week before RRR Week.}
        If you ever find that you are struggling to finish some requirements and are worried that you won't be able to complete some of them, please reach out to your EVP and we'll work something out.
    
    \section{Bit-Byte Groups}
    \label{sec:bit-byte-groups}
        A core part of the Candidate Semester involves being in a \textbf{Bit-Byte Group}!
        This is HKN's big-little system, where Candidates are Bits and Members are Bytes.
        As a Bit, you'll be matched with 2-4 other Bits and 2 Bytes.
        As mentioned in the requirements, there are 3 required Bit-Byte Hangouts.
        These will be organized by your Bytes or you can suggest what you want your group to do as well! \\

        The goal of Bit-Byte Groups is for you to have a little family you can reach out to go to events together, ask questions about the Candidate Semester, and have members in HKN that you can always reach out to.
        During/after Candidate Meeting, you'll learn about the Bytes you can be a Bit under and will fill out a preference form to get matched.
        Then, at General Meeting 1, you'll get to meet your Bit-Byte Group for the semester!
        This semester, we'll be having Bit-Byte challenges for your group to complete and gain points over the semester.
        Some events will also be focused specifically on putting groups against other groups in fun games. \\

        If you ever encounter any issues with your Bit-Byte group, such as inactivity, feel free to reach out to your EVP to get the problem resolved.

    \section{Candidate Project}
    \label{sec:candidate-project}
        As mentioned in the requirements, one of your biggest tasks as a Candidate is to complete your Candidate Project.
        The goal of this requirement is to give you a chance of contributing to the services that HKN provides to the community, the department, and its members.
        What your project entails depends on which committee you are assigned to!
        To see specific committees and the projects they are offering this semester, please see the \hyperref[ch:committees]{Committees section} later in this document.
        
    \section{Initiation and Banquet}
    \label{sec:initiation-and-banquet}
        The Candidate Semester culminates in Initation and Banquet.
        More details about these events will be released during General Meeting 2 and General Meeting 3.

    \section{Elections}
    \label{sec:elections}
        Elections follow the day after Initiation and Banquet.
        While you will be inducted as a lifetime member of HKN during Initiation, if you really enjoyed your time as a Candidate, want to take on more responsibilities, and help contribute to a committee, you can run for officership at Elections.
        Running for officership is a commitment for the next semester, so if you run and get a position at Spring '24 Elections, you will be an officer during Fall '24.
        Every member (including initiated candidates) is encouraged to come to elections and say their thoughts for people running. \\
        
        \textbf{
            Running for officership is entirely optional and will not affect your membership in HKN in any way if you do not choose to run.
            You will still be able to attend meetings, contribute to a committee, and everything else just by being a member.
        } \\

        There are two officership roles: Officer and Assistant Officer (AO).
        Committee duties between the two roles are the same, with the only difference between the two being the amount of general required HKN duties.
        The required duties of officership include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item
                Performing your responsibilities as part of a committee.
                This includes weekly committee meetings.
            \item
                Attending weekly officer meetings, known as HKN Meetings (HM).
            \item
                Attending important non-recurring meetings, i.e. Retreat, Candidate Meeting (CM), General Meetings (GM), invited Executive Meetings (EM), etc.
            \item
                2 or 1 hour(s) of Tutoring hours for Officers and AOs, respectively.
            \item
                3 or 2 of the following duties for Officers and AOs, respectively: fruit snack handouts after lower-division exams or office cleaning.
            \item
                Participating in the Candidate Semester by attending at least one candidate event, in addition to hosting officer hangouts, giving out officer challenges, etc.
            \item
                Attending Banquet.
            \item
                Helping with inter-committee duties, i.e. assisting a committee that is not your own with one of their events.
        \end{itemize}
        Elections begin in the morning, end in the early evening, and transition into \emph{Midnight Meeting} at night.
        Midnight Meeting is where all the newly-elected officers come and have their first meeting to discuss overall sentiment of the semester and new initiatives/changes for the following semester. \\

        Elections are led by the President, External Vice President, and Recording Secretary.
        For each committee, including the Executive committee, we do the following process:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item
                We first ask for any nominations.
                If you want to run for officership, tell your fellow Bits and your Bytes to nominate you during the nomination phase.
                You can also nominate yourself if you're not comfortable asking others.
            \item
                We then ask the nominees to confirm if they truly want to run for the position.
                In the first round, you can either \colorbox{green}{accept}, \colorbox{yellow}{defer}, or \colorbox{red}{reject}, with defer meaning you will give your final say to accept or reject in the second round.
            \item
                For those who accepted, we ask them to come up to the front of the room and write their commitments for the following semester.
                This includes classes, other club commitments, research, work, etc.
            \item
                We then ask a series of questions, ranging from why they think they are a good fit for the committee, what new initiatives they might bring, etc.
                Each person is given a time limit to respond to each question.
                Those in the audience are also allowed to ask questions, and these typically come from older officers who have been on the committee previously.
            \item
                After enough questions are asked and we feel that we are satisfied with the responses, we ask the people running to temporarily leave the room.
                Those in the Elections room then deliberate on the candidates and their responses, since there are limited officer spots and there are typically more candidates than available spots.
            \item
                Once deliberation has concluded, the audience votes for the members they think should be an officer.
                Those with the highest votes become officers for however many spots there are.
                In the case that many people are running for the same position, runoff elections may be held.
            \item
                We then bring back the candidates into the room, congratulate them for running, and announce who won.
                We then repeat the process with the remaining committees.
        \end{enumerate}
        If you ever have questions about officership or Elections, feel free to ask your Byte or any other member you feel comfortable chatting with!
        During the latter half of the Candidate Semester, you'll have a Candidate Check-in with your EVP to discuss if you're interested in any committees for officership!

    \newpage
    \chapter{Committees}
    \label{ch:committees}
